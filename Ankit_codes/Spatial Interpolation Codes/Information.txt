These codes take three input files - one which provides dimensions of ther daily files (month06list.xlsx), one which provides the names of the files as a list in text (month06list.txt) and one which provides the lat-lon extents of the model for which the interpolation is to be performed. Attached are also the .mat files that are produced as outputs of these codes for the year 2006, both the monthly means as well as the filewise variable data. For more information refer to the code itself. The same code works for different months, just make sure all the relevant files are in the same folder. Only thing that needs to be changed is the name of the folder in which the files are stored, and the name of the output files, as well as the starting date of the month (in Julian format).
